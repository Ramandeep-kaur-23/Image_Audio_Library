Created a python library for basic mathematics functions. It involves arithmetic functions like, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. it also involves the functions of areas of different shapes like circle, rectangle, etc. All these functions are defines under two files named area and arithmetic. Then one file called implementation is created where the library is implemented in simple code and also accessed the modules made by me.
